# Frequency Analysis Lab Projects

## Introduction

These projects are connected with Fouries series and transformations and their using in tasks of series analysing, audio filtering, stock data smoothing and more.

## Lab Projects

1.  Fourier Series Analysing;
2.  Fourier Transformations Implementation;
3.  Strict Filtering (especially in audio processing);
4.  Linear Filtering (especially in stock data smoothing);
5.  Connection between Continuous and Discrete (in aspects of sampling and Nyquist-Kotelnikov theorem).
